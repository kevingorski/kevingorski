# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a long-time web engineer who's currently balancing fatherhood (my daughter Hazel is 9 months old as of August, 2023) with freelancing and building income-generating assets like DenoDevs ([WIP repo here](https://github.com/kevingorski/denodevs.io)).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Deno and Fresh in hopes that it proves to be a better DevEx than Node.js and worth working with for the long term
- ðŸŒ± I'm also learning how to market and distribute my work more widely
- ðŸ‘€ The best place to see what I'm up to is [my professional site](https://kgsoftwarellc.com)
- ðŸ“« My personal email is listed to the left if you'd like to reach out!
